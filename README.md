# Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## JSON-SERVER

Install json-server as `npm install -g json-server`.
To get the data run `json-server --watch <path-to>/db.json`
The json-server runs on `http://localhost:3000`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

#### TODO's

1.) The custom grid had few rendering issues and needed some more debugging, hence used ag-grid (off-the-shelf) component.		
2.) The SCSS files needs clean-up.
